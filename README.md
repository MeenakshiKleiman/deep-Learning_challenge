Overview
Develop, optimize, and evaluate a deep learning model to predict the success of Alphabet Soup-funded organizations.

Instructions
Step 1: Data Preprocessing
Load and Explore Data: Read charity_data.csv into a Pandas DataFrame.
Data Cleaning: Drop EIN and NAME columns, combine rare categorical values, and encode categorical variables.
Split Data: Separate data into features (X) and target (y), then split into training and testing sets.
Scale Data: Use StandardScaler to scale the features.
Step 2: Build and Train the Model
Model Design: Create a neural network with appropriate layers and activation functions.
Compile and Train: Compile the model with binary_crossentropy and adam, and train it.
Evaluate: Assess model accuracy and loss on test data. Save the model as AlphabetSoupCharity.h5.
Step 3: Optimize the Model
Adjust Data: Revisit preprocessing, refine data handling.
Enhance Model: Experiment with layers, neurons, activation functions, and epochs.
Save Model: Save the optimized model as AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5.
Step 4: Write a Report
Overview: Explain the analysis purpose.
Results: Discuss preprocessing, model architecture, and optimization steps.
Summary: Summarize findings and recommend alternative models.
Step 5: Submission
Download Files: Download and organize Colab notebooks.
Push to GitHub: Move files to your local repository and push to GitHub.
