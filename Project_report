Data Preprocessing
Target Variable:
The target variable for the model is the 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column, which indicates whether the charity was successful.
Feature Variables:
The feature variables are all other columns in the dataset after dropping the 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column.
Removed Variables:
The 'EIN' and 'NAME' columns were removed as they do not contribute to the predictive model and are neither target nor feature variables.
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
Model Architecture:
The initial model architecture included two hidden layers:
First Hidden Layer: 8 neurons with ReLU activation.
Second Hidden Layer: 5 neurons with ReLU activation.
These configurations were chosen as starting points and were adjusted in subsequent attempts to improve performance.
Model Performance:
The initial model did not achieve the target accuracy of 75%, instead reaching approximately 73%.
Optimization Attempts:
To improve accuracy, the following steps were taken:
Added more hidden layers to increase model complexity.
Adjusted the number of neurons in each layer.
Removed additional columns that might introduce noise.
Experimented with different activation functions.
Increased and decreased the number of layers to find the optimal balance.
Summary
Overall Results:
The final deep learning model achieved an accuracy of around 73%, which is close to but below the target of 75%.
